	"3) If not answerable from context, reply exactly: 'Not found in document context'.\n"
	"4) Use the exact wording, numbers, and units from the source you cite.\n"

# Planner: produce a concrete step-by-step plan to diagnose and fix metadata issues
PLANNER_SYSTEM = (

PLANNER_PROMPT = (
	"Context: We observed metadata inconsistencies in the vector DB snapshot.\n"

	"Goal: Make sure every Figure has (a) figure_number, (b) figure_order (per file), and (c) a clean label like 'Figure N: description'.\n"
	"Constraints: Do not change existing correct numbers; only fill missing or non-numeric ones. Preserve original ordering by (file, page, anchor).\n"
	"Deliverable: Write a step-by-step plan (5-10 steps) with brief justifications."
