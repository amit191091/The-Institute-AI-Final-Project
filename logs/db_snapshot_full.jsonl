Baseline “Healthy” recordings were collected in February 2023 (with no abnormal indications through 8 April 2023). The first onset of wear was detected on 9 April 2023 and was tracked across 35 sequential wear cases through 15 June 2023, when elevated noise and vibration culminated in a functional failure that necessitated shutdown. Monitoring used accelerometers placed on gearbox housings adjacent to the input and output shafts, sampling at 50 kHz for 60-second windows per record. Recording intervals followed the actual time stamps in the site Database log; per session, it was indicated whether records were close (≈1 minute apart), spaced by minutes, or collected in morning/afternoon/evening clusters.", "words": 154}

Vibration signal processing and Image processing were performed for analysis. The gearbox transmission lubrication in service was 2640 semi-synthetic, 15W/40 viscosity. All signals were record at speed 45 RPS and 15 RPS. System Description Vessel and Transmission: INS Haifa employs a conventional marine propulsion train. The subject gearbox is an MG-5025A naval reduction gear, configured as part of the ship’s main gear transmission. The investigated component is the primary reduction gear pair (driving gear and driven gear). Lubrication: Sump and spray lubrication with 2640 semi-synthetic (15W/40) oil maintained to standard naval cleanliness targets.\n\nNo bulk oil temperature logging was available for this investigation period. Operating Conditions: Data were acquired at two steady speeds: 45 RPS (Full speed) and 15 RPS (Minimum).

This low-variance RMS trace indicates: 1. Stable shaft alignment and no assembly errors. 2. No abnormal gear contact, or unbalance speed (speed fluctuations). In Spectral Domain Analysis, the companion spectrograms and FFT snapshots captured during operation showed a narrow-band signature dominated by the gear transmission and shafts. Peaks were sharp and of low amplitude, with minimal broadband energy and no sidebands around the Gear Mesh Frequencies (and their harmonics) — patterns that would normally indicate early abnormal anomalies associated with unstable meshing. High- frequency content (above the mesh and its first few harmonics) was quiescent, consistent with an undamaged surface topology.\n\nThe combination of low, stable RMS and a clean, narrow-band spectrum establishes a robust reference for the campaign that follows. With the new data-acquisition now calibrated and in service, any subsequent departures from this February 13 signature — be they gradual RMS lift, incipient sidebands, or broadband rise — are attributable to evolving contact conditions rather than instrumentation artifacts.

Investigation Findings The investigation was based on continuous monitoring of the gear system using the newly installed data acquisition unit. The unit enabled parallel analysis of both the time and spectral domains, combined with systematic inspection of gear teeth profiles through high- resolution images. This dual approach—signal monitoring and visual assessment—allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the wear progression. The findings are described chronologically, starting with the healthy baseline and continuing through mild, moderate, severe wear, and finally the failure stage.\n\nBaseline Condition From February 13 to April 8, the system was operating under normal conditions, and the initial dataset established the baseline profile for both vibration signals and spectral distribution. In the time domain, the signal presented a uniform oscillatory pattern without irregular fluctuations.

A small deviation from the healthy baseline was visible on the flanks of several teeth, although the signals remained largely unchanged at this early stage. Between April 9 and April 23, progressive visual changes were observed: tooth wear was visible in the photographs but did not yet manifest in the vibration data.

The alignment between visual degradation and signal variation validated the progression of wear beyond the mild stage. Severe Wear Progression From May 14 to June 11, the wear advanced into the severe stage.

Corresponding tooth images depicted extensive surface damage, including deep pits and irregular wear patches. The severity of the damage made it clear that the component was approaching its functional limits, with reduced load-carrying capability and high risk of imminent failure. Failure Stage On June 15, the system experienced a critical failure directly attributed to the severe progression of wear. The failure manifested as a sudden reduction in energy observed across both time and spectral analyses, consistent with a loss of mechanical engagement within the gear set. The RMS levels, which had peaked during severe wear, showed an abrupt decline, reflecting the collapse of normal vibration transmission.

Conclusion The investigation into the progressive wear of the driven gear tooth, supported by both visual inspections and vibration analysis, leads to several clear conclusions regarding the evolution of the fault and its ultimate failure. At the outset, under baseline conditions, the system operated normally. The newly installed data acquisition system allowed simultaneous analysis in both the time and spectral domains, providing a reliable foundation for monitoring. No anomalies were detected, and the RMS levels, frequency signatures, and waveform patterns all reflected a healthy gear profile.\n\nThe first signs of abnormality emerged during the mild wear stage, beginning on April 9. Visual inspection of the gear tooth photographs revealed subtle deviations from the healthy profile well before the signals reflected any variation. Between April 9 and April 23, the wear gradually became more evident in the images, while the vibration signals remained stable at lower wear cases.
