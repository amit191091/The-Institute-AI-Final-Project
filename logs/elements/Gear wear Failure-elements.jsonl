Baseline “Healthy” \nrecordings were collected in February 2023 (with no abnormal indications through 8 April \n2023). The first onset of wear was detected on 9 April 2023 and was tracked across 35 \nsequential wear cases through 15 June 2023, when elevated noise and vibration culminated \nin a functional failure that necessitated shutdown. \nMonitoring used accelerometers placed on gearbox housings adjacent to the input and \noutput shafts, sampling at 50 kHz for 60-second windows per record. Recording intervals \nfollowed the actual time stamps in the site Database log; per session, it was indicated \nwhether records were close (≈1 minute apart), spaced by minutes, or collected in \nmorning/afternoon/evening clusters. \nAcross April–June, crews consistently reported louder gear noise under steady speed and a \ngradual rise in overall vibration level. Time-domain RMS, trended upward in step with the \nWear Case 1 → 35 progression, the wear depth are labeled in Table 1 . The final day (15 \nJune) showed a marked jump in amplitude and transient impulsive responses consistent \nwith severe war liberation on a loaded flank, followed by immediate operational \nwithdrawal. \nVibration signal processing and Image processing were performed for analysis. The gearbox \ntransmission lubrication in service was 2640 semi-synthetic, 15W/40 viscosity. All signals \nwere record at speed 45 RPS and 15 RPS. \nSystem Description \nVessel and Transmission: INS Haifa employs a conventional marine propulsion train. The \nsubject gearbox is an MG-5025A naval reduction gear, configured as part of the ship’s main \ngear transmission. The investigated component is the primary reduction gear pair (driving \ngear and driven gear). \nLubrication: Sump and spray lubrication with 2640 semi-synthetic (15W/40) oil \nmaintained to standard naval cleanliness targets. No bulk oil temperature logging was \navailable for this investigation period. \nOperating Conditions: Data were acquired at two steady speeds: 45 RPS (Full speed) and \n15 RPS (Minimum). \nInstrumentation & Acquisition: Two industrial accelerometers mounted on the gearbox \ncasing near input and output shafts. The accelerometers direction measurements were at \nthe gravity direction. 60-second time records, 50 kHz sampling rate."}

Images \nserved as qualitative corroboration of wear evolution (Healthy teeth → micro-wear → \nmacro-wear). They are appeared in Figure 1. \nFailure Progression \nOn February 13, a new data-acquisition chain was installed, commissioned, and verified on \nthe MG-5025A gearbox aboard INS Haifa. The commissioning included channel polarity \nchecks, sensor seating verification, and a short functional run at both operating regimes. The \nmonitoring protocol established for all subsequent records was: 60-second time records, 50 \nkHz sampling rate, and timestamping according to the DATABASE log; intervals between \nrecords on this date ranged from 1–10 minutes during commissioning bursts (e.g., 13:32→\n13:33→13:34→13:35, then 13:49→13:50→13:53…) and later ~8–15 minutes during \nsteadier operation blocks. Photographic documentation of the gear teeth was also initiated \non this date using a high-magnification digital microscope camera for surface tracking. \nIn Time Domain Analysis, the RMS vibration levels at 45 RPS (and in later same-day checks \nat 15 RPS) were consistently low and steady, exhibiting the hallmark of a healthy drivetrain: \nno bursts, no intermittent spikes, and no slow drift. This low-variance RMS trace indicates: \n1. Stable shaft alignment and no assembly errors. \n2. No abnormal gear contact, or unbalance speed (speed fluctuations). \nIn Spectral Domain Analysis, the companion spectrograms and FFT snapshots captured \nduring operation showed a narrow-band signature dominated by the gear transmission and \nshafts. Peaks were sharp and of low amplitude, with minimal broadband energy and no \nsidebands around the Gear Mesh Frequencies (and their harmonics) — patterns that would \nnormally indicate early abnormal anomalies associated with unstable meshing. High-\nfrequency content (above the mesh and its first few harmonics) was quiescent, consistent \nwith an undamaged surface topology. \nThe combination of low, stable RMS and a clean, narrow-band spectrum establishes a robust \nreference for the campaign that follows. With the new data-acquisition now calibrated and \nin service, any subsequent departures from this February 13 signature — be they gradual \nRMS lift, incipient sidebands, or broadband rise — are attributable to evolving contact \nconditions rather than instrumentation artifacts. This baseline therefore ensures later \ninterpretation of fault progression observed across the dated sequences in the DATABASE. \nThere were approximately 500 records for the baseline, evenly split between the two \nspeeds. \nMild Wear \nThe earliest sign that the system had departed from the baseline came from the microscope \ntooth photographs taken on April 9.

In comparison to the baseline, the time-domain waveforms \nshowed no gross abnormalities, and the RMS trend initially appeared steady. Yet in the \nspectra, small but systematic departures emerged. At 45 RPS, faint sidebands began to \nfeather the principal mesh lines, and the broadband floor above the first few mesh \nharmonics lifted slightly relative to the exceptionally quiet baseline. Evening runs confirmed \nthe persistence of these effects. At 15 RPS, spectra carried the same tendencies with more \nhigh-frequency smearing, reflecting lubrication sensitivity rather than discrete failure. \nThere were no wide sideband families or discrete fault lines; rather, the vibration patterns \nsuggested incipient modulation consistent with early flank wear. Across subsequent \ninspections, the photographs continued to reveal progressive changes, notably in the sets \nfrom April 16 and April 23, while vibration signals began to register measurable deviations \nonly by the latter date. By April 23, RMS levels were consistently above the baseline, \nespecially at 45 RPS, and the spectral lift was no longer ambiguous. \nCrucially, the timeline of evidence shows that the photographs provided the first definitive \nindications of wear, while the vibration data only followed with measurable confirmation by \nApril 23. This ordering is important diagnostically: it rules out spurious instrument effects \nand highlights that the onset of Mild Wear spans those days, characterized by: \n1. First visible tooth profile deviations. \n2. Small but persistent RMS elevation. \n3. Nascent sideband activity with a slight broadband rise, well short of severe damage.  \nModerate Wear \nThe transition from mild to moderate wear became evident on April 23 afternoon, when \nsuccessive microscope photographs showed the first clearly measurable changes in the \ntooth contact geometry. Compared directly with the April 9 images, the worn area had \ngrown beyond subtle polishing: a more distinct flattening of the flank region was visible, \nwith contact extending deeper into the profile and localized material loss forming a brighter \nreflective patch. This physical evidence, captured under consistent magnification, signaled \nthat wear had advanced into a stage where surface integrity was being materially altered. \nContemporaneous vibration records reinforced this interpretation. At 45 RPS, an afternoon \nsequence from 14:12 to 14:54 and a subsequent evening set at 17:58–18:36 exhibited RMS \nlevels elevated by roughly 10–15% above the April 9 reference, with the increases stable \nacross consecutive runs. Spectrally, the shaft and gear-mesh lines remained dominant, but \nsideband families around the mesh frequencies, which had been faint feathering in early \nApril, now emerged as systematic low-amplitude bands separated by shaft frequency.

This dual evidence — photographic flattening of the flank region and repeatable \nvibro-acoustic departures — remained consistent through the following days. \nThe April 27–29 campaigns documented progressive expansion of the worn zone in the \nmicroscope images, while vibration records at both 45 and 15 RPS sustained the elevated \nRMS and strengthened sideband structures. By May 3, photographs showed contact scars \nencroaching across multiple teeth, with clear edges rather than the diffuse polishing seen \nearlier, and vibration spectra exhibited broader and more numerous sidebands, alongside a \nfurther rise in the high-frequency floor. The RMS growth remained gradual, avoiding \nimpulsive spikes, which aligned with a wear mechanism dominated by abrasive smoothing \nrather than fracture or chipping. \nTaken together, the evidence from April 23 through May 7 defines the Moderate Wear stage, \ncharacterized by: \n1. Photographs revealing enlarging contact scars and measurable loss of original flank \ncurvature. \n2. RMS values at both operating speeds trending consistently upward by 10–20% \nrelative to April 9. \n3. Spectral content displaying organized sideband families and a rising broadband floor \nacross successive days. \nThis stage thus marks the progression from micro-texture alteration into geometrically \nsignificant wear, recognizable in both visual and vibro-acoustic domains, but still without \ncatastrophic features such as broken teeth or impulsive shock signatures.  \nSevere Wear \nThe transition into severe wear was first documented on May 14, when microscope \nphotographs revealed sharp-edged scars and material loss extending across large sections of \nthe tooth flank. Unlike the smoother polishing or gradual flattening seen during the \nmoderate stage, the worn regions now displayed darker, roughened textures intermixed \nwith bright reflective zones, characteristic of scuffing and surface tearing. Contact scars \nwidened significantly, consuming much of the original flank geometry, with visible depth \nvariations along the wear path. These changes were not confined to isolated teeth: by mid-\nMay, photographs confirmed that multiple consecutive teeth exhibited similar damage, \nestablishing that the wear mechanism had advanced to a system-wide condition."}

At 45 \nRPS, records from May 14 onward showed RMS values elevated by 25–40% above the April \n9 baseline, with fluctuations indicating unstable running conditions. Spectral content was \nmarkedly altered: sidebands around the mesh frequency became dominant features rather \nthan faint modulations, appearing as dense families with higher amplitudes. The broadband \nnoise floor above 5 kHz rose sharply, pointing to asperity impacts and increased surface \nroughness. \nAt 15 RPS, the contrast was even more striking. RMS values spiked relative to moderate \nwear levels, and spectra showed both smearing and intermittent high-frequency bursts — \nsignatures of unstable contact. As May progressed into June, the microscope evidence grew \nincreasingly severe. By May 28, images showed deep scarring with localized pitting and \npossible micro-fractures at the tooth edges. The worn areas were no longer limited to profile \nflattening; instead, they exhibited irregular depth and texture, consistent with material \nremoval rather than gradual smoothing. \nParallel vibration data confirmed this escalation: at both speeds, RMS levels remained \nelevated, but more importantly, transient impulsive peaks appeared intermittently in the \ntime traces. These impulses coincided with sudden rises in the high-frequency spectral \nband, suggesting localized crack initiation or debris entrainment within the mesh. By June \n11, the gear teeth displayed widespread, advanced surface failure. Contact regions had lost \nmost of their original geometry, and scarring extended across the majority of the flank \nsurface. \nVibration measurements reinforced this terminal state: spectra were dominated by \nbroadband noise and strong, irregular sidebands, with RMS values far above the initial \nbaseline and unstable from run to run. This combined photographic and vibro-acoustic \nevidence defines the Severe Wear stage, characterized by: \n1. Extensive and system-wide loss of tooth surface geometry. \n2. Vibration signatures characterized by large RMS growth, dense sidebands, and \nimpulsive transients. \n3. Evidence of local pitting and fracture precursors visible in the microscope images. \nTaken together, the period from May 14 to June 11 marks the culmination of the wear \nprocess. What began in early April as mild polishing and progressed through measurable \ngeometric flattening by late April had, by mid-May, developed into advanced scarring, \nunstable dynamics, and precursors of catastrophic gear failure. \nFailure \nOn June 15, the wear process reached its terminal stage and culminated in a failure event \ndirectly attributable to the progression of severe wear. Microscope inspection on this date \nrevealed catastrophic surface damage: large sections of the tooth flanks were no longer \nintact, with deep gouges, fragmented edges, and visible fracture of material layers.

At both 15 and 45 \nRPS, RMS levels showed unstable reductions compared to the peak values observed earlier \nin June. This apparent drop in energy does not signify recovery but rather a loss of dynamic \nstiffness and engagement efficiency due to surface collapse. Once significant material is \nremoved, the gear pair no longer transmits load in a uniform manner. Instead, contact is \nintermittent and incomplete, producing lower average vibration energy despite the \ndestructive nature of the event. \nSpectra from June 15 confirm this interpretation: while broadband noise and irregular \nsidebands remain, their energy distribution is fragmented, with missing components that \nwere previously stable indicators of mesh dynamics. This reduction in measured energy is \ntherefore a diagnostic marker of failure, not of improvement. It reflects the fact that the gear \nsystem has lost its ability to sustain consistent mesh forces — much of the excitation \npreviously producing vibration has been dissipated by material loss, plastic deformation, \nand partial disengagement. Microscope evidence of fractured surfaces and spalled zones \nfully corroborates this interpretation. \nAccordingly, June 15 marks the transition from Severe Wear to Failure: \n1. Photographic evidence: complete breakdown of flank geometry, spalling, deep \ngouging, fractured material. \n2. Vibration evidence: unstable RMS values and reduced spectral energy due to loss of \nengagement. \n3. Physical meaning: the gear pair can no longer transfer energy effectively; the system \nhas entered a failed state. \nInvestigation Findings \nThe investigation was based on continuous monitoring of the gear system using the newly \ninstalled data acquisition unit. The unit enabled parallel analysis of both the time and \nspectral domains, combined with systematic inspection of gear teeth profiles through high-\nresolution images. This dual approach—signal monitoring and visual assessment—allowed \nfor a comprehensive understanding of the wear progression. The findings are described \nchronologically, starting with the healthy baseline and continuing through mild, moderate, \nsevere wear, and finally the failure stage. \nBaseline Condition \nFrom February 13 to April 8, the system was operating under normal conditions, and the \ninitial dataset established the baseline profile for both vibration signals and spectral \ndistribution. In the time domain, the signal presented a uniform oscillatory pattern without \nirregular fluctuations.

Corresponding gear images showed \nintact teeth profiles without visible irregularities. This baseline was later used as the \nbenchmark for all subsequent comparisons. \nMild Wear Progression \nThe first signs of wear appeared on April 9, initially detected through tooth profile images. A \nsmall deviation from the healthy baseline was visible on the flanks of several teeth, although \nthe signals remained largely unchanged at this early stage. Between April 9 and April 23, \nprogressive visual changes were observed: tooth wear was visible in the photographs but \ndid not yet manifest in the vibration data. From April 16 onward, subtle variations emerged \nin both time domain and spectral domain signals, with small irregularities beginning to \ndisrupt the smooth baseline pattern. These deviations, while still minor, marked the \ntransition toward measurable wear. By April 23, RMS values rose above the baseline, \nconfirming the onset of detectable wear in both the visual and signal-based assessments. \nModerate Wear Progression \nFrom the afternoon of April 23 until May 7, the system entered a phase characterized as \nmoderate wear. During this period, both time domain and spectral indicators showed clear \ndivergence from the healthy reference. RMS values exhibited a sustained upward trend, and \nthe time domain signals developed pronounced irregularities, including asymmetry in the \noscillatory waveforms. Spectral analysis confirmed the presence of secondary peaks not \nobserved in the baseline, suggesting energy redistribution across higher harmonics. Images \nof the gear teeth revealed progressively deeper wear scars, with surface material visibly \nremoved and sharpness lost at the edges. The alignment between visual degradation and \nsignal variation validated the progression of wear beyond the mild stage. \nSevere Wear Progression \nFrom May 14 to June 11, the wear advanced into the severe stage. Signal data during this \nphase showed significant energy concentration shifts in the spectral domain, with \nbroadening peaks and elevated noise levels. The time domain traces became increasingly \nerratic, reflecting unstable operation of the gear system. RMS values climbed markedly, far \nexceeding both the baseline and moderate wear levels. Corresponding tooth images \ndepicted extensive surface damage, including deep pits and irregular wear patches. The \nseverity of the damage made it clear that the component was approaching its functional \nlimits, with reduced load-carrying capability and high risk of imminent failure. \nFailure Stage \nOn June 15, the system experienced a critical failure directly attributed to the severe \nprogression of wear. The failure manifested as a sudden reduction in energy observed \nacross both time and spectral analyses, consistent with a loss of mechanical engagement \nwithin the gear set. The RMS levels, which had peaked during severe wear, showed an \nabrupt decline, reflecting the collapse of normal vibration transmission.

This final stage concluded the wear cycle, with the failure \noutcome linked directly to the unchecked escalation of wear processes documented in the \npreceding stages. \nRecommendations \nBased on the investigation and conclusions, the following recommendations are proposed to \nenhance early detection, monitoring, and prevention of gear tooth wear and failure in future \noperations. \nIntegrate Routine Visual Inspections \n1. Photographic inspection proved to be the earliest and most sensitive method for \ndetecting the onset of wear. \n2. It is recommended to establish a routine photographic monitoring program, using \nstandardized lighting and scale references to ensure comparability between \ninspection dates. \n3. Image-based measurements (e.g., depth, area loss, surface roughness) should be \nquantified where possible, not just qualitatively assessed. \nEnhance Vibration Monitoring Strategy \n1. The vibration signals only reflected deviations once the wear reached moderate \nseverity, but they became critical indicators of progression thereafter. \n2. RMS monitoring thresholds should be updated based on the observed patterns, with \nlower alarm levels to flag deviations earlier. \n3. Frequency-domain monitoring should emphasize sidebands around the gear \nmeshing frequency, as these were reliable markers of moderate-to-severe wear. \n4. Waveform irregularity (time-domain pattern distortion) should be formally included \nin diagnostic criteria, as it provided useful confirmation of deterioration. \nDevelop Predictive Maintenance Protocols \n1. Establish a wear progression model linking image-based wear depth to vibration \nfeatures (RMS increase, sideband growth, harmonic distortion). \n2. Use this model to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the gear before \ncatastrophic failure. \n3. Define intervention thresholds: \n• \nMild wear stage: Record and monitor closely. \n• \nModerate wear stage: Schedule planned replacement or refurbishment at \nearliest convenience. \n• \nSevere wear stage: Immediate intervention required to prevent failure."}

Incorporate AI-driven feature extraction from images (surface crack detection, \npitting quantification) to support objective, repeatable assessments. \n3. Store all monitoring data in a central database to enable trend analysis and long-\nterm system health assessment. \nSchedule Post-Failure Review Protocols \n1. After any future gear replacement or failure, conduct structured reviews that \ncombine metallurgical inspection, vibration records, and photographic analysis. \n2. Lessons learned should feed back into threshold calibration and preventive \nstrategies. \nOverall Recommendation: \nA dual-path monitoring framework should be adopted, where visual inspection detects the \nearliest onset of wear, while vibration analysis tracks its progression and severity. Proactive \nthresholds and predictive modeling must guide intervention well before the transition into \nsevere wear, thereby avoiding unexpected catastrophic failures such as the one observed on \nJune 15. \nConclusion \nThe investigation into the progressive wear of the driven gear tooth, supported by both \nvisual inspections and vibration analysis, leads to several clear conclusions regarding the \nevolution of the fault and its ultimate failure. \nAt the outset, under baseline conditions, the system operated normally. The newly installed \ndata acquisition system allowed simultaneous analysis in both the time and spectral \ndomains, providing a reliable foundation for monitoring. No anomalies were detected, and \nthe RMS levels, frequency signatures, and waveform patterns all reflected a healthy gear \nprofile. \nThe first signs of abnormality emerged during the mild wear stage, beginning on April 9. \nVisual inspection of the gear tooth photographs revealed subtle deviations from the healthy \nprofile well before the signals reflected any variation. Between April 9 and April 23, the \nwear gradually became more evident in the images, while the vibration signals remained \nstable at lower wear cases. Onward did the time-domain signals begin showing slight"}

A more distinct change appeared by W13, when the RMS values \nrose above the baseline. This established that the earliest effective indicator of wear was \nvisual, while the dynamic response lagged behind. \nFrom April 23 to May 7, the gear entered the moderate wear stage. Here, both time-domain \nand frequency-domain analyses showed consistent deviations. The RMS values rose further, \nthe waveform displayed irregularity, and the spectral data revealed emerging sidebands \naround the meshing frequency, pointing to the onset of mechanical instability. These \nfindings matched the photographic evidence, where tooth surface deterioration became \nincreasingly visible. The progression demonstrated that once wear passes a certain \nthreshold, signal analysis becomes a reliable diagnostic tool, complementing the images. \nThe severe wear stage was observed between May 14 and June 11. During this period, the \nmechanical degradation accelerated. The RMS levels escalated significantly, waveform \ndistortion became pronounced, and spectral content showed clear harmonics and sideband \ngrowth. The photographic record confirmed substantial material loss and deformation of the \ntooth surface. At this point, the wear process transitioned from a detectable but controlled \nfault to one posing imminent risk of failure. \nOn June 15, the progression culminated in a complete failure. The worn gear tooth fractured \nunder load, resulting in a critical mechanical malfunction. The energy transmitted through \nthe system dropped sharply, consistent with the interruption of load transfer due to the \ntooth breakage. This failure was the direct outcome of prolonged severe wear, highlighting \nthe importance of early detection and timely intervention. \nIn summary, the conclusions are as follows: \n1. The newly installed data acquisition system successfully enabled dual-domain \nanalysis, confirming the value of combining time- and frequency-based monitoring. \n2. Photographic inspections provided the earliest indicators of wear, visible from April \n9, well before measurable vibration deviations. \n3. Mild wear persisted until April 23, during which signals remained largely unaffected, \nunderscoring the importance of visual monitoring at early stages. \n4. Moderate wear from April 23 to May 7 was marked by consistent RMS increases, \nsignal irregularities, and spectral sidebands, validating the progression of the fault. \n5. Severe wear between May 14 and June 11 showed rapid escalation, clear in both \nsignals and photographs, demonstrating the system’s deteriorating condition. \n6. Final failure on June 15 occurred due to gear tooth fracture, directly caused by \nunchecked severe wear, explaining the observed reduction in system energy. \nThese findings confirm the complementary role of image-based inspection and vibration \nanalysis, and they establish a clear timeline of the wear process leading to failure."}
