Enhance Vibration Monitoring Strategy - The vibration signals only reflected deviations once the wear reached moderate severity, but they became critical indicators of progression thereafter. - RMS monitoring thresholds should be updated based on the observed patterns, with lower alarm levels to flag deviations earlier. - Frequency-domain monitoring should emphasize sidebands around the gear meshing frequency, as these were reliable markers of moderate-to-severe wear. 4. Waveform irregularity (time-domain pattern distortion) should be formally included in diagnostic criteria, as it provided useful confirmation of deterioration. Develop Predictive Maintenance Protocols - Establish a wear progression model linking image-based wear depth to vibration features (RMS increase, sideband growth, harmonic distortion). - Use this model to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the gear before catastrophic failure. - Define intervention thresholds: Mild wear stage: Record and monitor closely. • Moderate wear stage: Schedule planned replacement or refurbishment at earliest convenience.
