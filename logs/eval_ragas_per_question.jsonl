Clear visual wear with deeper scars and material loss. Spectral analysis showed increased sideband activity around meshing frequency.\n\n* **Severe Wear Progression (May 14th - June 11th):** Significant RMS increase, pronounced waveform distortion, and strong harmonic/sideband growth in spectral data.
