{"question": "On what date was the first onset of wear detected by visual inspection?", "answer": "* **First visual wear detection:** April 9 (photographic evidence of small deviations on gear tooth flanks).\n* **Mild wear phase:** April 9 - April 23 (visual changes progressed, vibration data initially unaffected, subtle variations emerged later).\n* **Moderate wear phase:** April 23 - May 7 (RMS values increased 10-15% above baseline, sidebands emerged in spectral analysis, visible surface material loss).\n* **Severe wear phase:** May 14 - June 11 (significant RMS increase, pronounced waveform distortion, spectral harmonics and sideband growth, extensive surface damage).\n* **Failure:** June 15 (gear tooth fracture under load, abrupt energy reduction).\n\n**Takeaway:** Visual inspection detected wear significantly earlier than vibration analysis.  While vibration data became valuable as wear progressed, early reliance on visual inspection is crucial for proactive maintenance.", "reference": "2023-04-09", "faithfulness": 1.0, "answer_relevancy": 0.6752040924434088, "context_precision": 0.8666666666377778, "context_recall": 1.0, "overlap_precision": 0.0, "overlap_recall": 0.0, "overlap_f1": 0.0}
{"question": "On what date did the system reach the failure stage?", "answer": "* **Baseline Established:** February 13th.  Healthy gear tooth profiles confirmed via visual inspection and vibration analysis (low, stable RMS values; clean, narrow-band spectrum).\n* **Mild Wear Detected:** April 9th.  Microscopic photography revealed initial surface wear, not yet reflected in vibration data.\n* **Moderate/Severe Wear Progression:**  Vibration analysis indicated increasing RMS levels, emergent sidebands around gear mesh frequency, and waveform irregularities, correlating with photographic evidence of worsening wear.  Specific dates for these stages are not provided in the given text.\n* **Failure Date:** Not explicitly stated in provided text. The document describes the *process* of failure but does not give a date for the final, catastrophic failure event.\n* **Failure Mode:**  Excessive gear tooth wear leading to material breakage and loss of function.\n\n**Takeaway:** Visual inspection detected wear earliest.
