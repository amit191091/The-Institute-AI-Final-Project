Normalized Frequency Modulation Energy (FME) also correlated with wear depth.\n\n* **Failure Mode:**  Unchecked wear escalation led to compromised tooth geometry, localized material breakage, and functional disengagement of the gear.\n\n* **Takeaway:** Visual inspection proved the most sensitive early detection method.
