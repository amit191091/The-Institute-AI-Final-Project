led to compromised tooth geometry, resulting in localized material breakage and functional 
disengagement of the gear. This final stage concluded the wear cycle, with the failure 
outcome linked directly to the unchecked escalation of wear processes documented in the 
preceding stages. 
Recommendations 
Based on the investigation and conclusions, the following recommendations are proposed to 
enhance early detection, monitoring, and prevention of gear tooth wear and failure in future 
operations. 
Integrate Routine Visual Inspections 
1. Photographic inspection proved to be the earliest and most sensitive method for 
detecting the onset of wear. 
2. It is recommended to establish a routine photographic monitoring program, using 
standardized lighting and scale references to ensure comparability between 
inspection dates. 
3. Image-based measurements (e.g., depth, area loss, surface roughness) should be 
quantified where possible, not just qualitatively assessed. 
Enhance Vibration Monitoring Strategy 
1. The vibration signals only reflected deviations once the wear reached moderate 
severity, but they became critical indicators of progression thereafter. 
2. RMS monitoring thresholds should be updated based on the observed patterns, with 
lower alarm levels to flag deviations earlier. 
3. Frequency-domain monitoring should emphasize sidebands around the gear 
meshing frequency, as these were reliable markers of moderate-to-severe wear. 
4. Waveform irregularity (time-domain pattern distortion) should be formally included 
in diagnostic criteria, as it provided useful confirmation of deterioration. 
Develop Predictive Maintenance Protocols 
1. Establish a wear progression model linking image-based wear depth to vibration 
features (RMS increase, sideband growth, harmonic distortion). 
2. Use this model to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the gear before 
catastrophic failure. 
3. Define intervention thresholds: 
• 
Mild wear stage: Record and monitor closely. 
• 
Moderate wear stage: Schedule planned replacement or refurbishment at 
earliest convenience. 
• 
Severe wear stage: Immediate intervention required to prevent failure.
