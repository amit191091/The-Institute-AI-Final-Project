Imaging: Following each measurement day, tooth-flank photographs were taken from the 
driven gear, using a camera integrated with the inspection microscope available in the lab 
(images archived in the shipyard file and referenced internally to the daily session). Images 
served as qualitative corroboration of wear evolution (Healthy teeth → micro-wear → 
macro-wear). They are appeared in Figure 1. 
Failure Progression 
On February 13, a new data-acquisition chain was installed, commissioned, and verified on 
the MG-5025A gearbox aboard INS Haifa. The commissioning included channel polarity 
checks, sensor seating verification, and a short functional run at both operating regimes. The 
monitoring protocol established for all subsequent records was: 60-second time records, 50 
kHz sampling rate, and timestamping according to the DATABASE log; intervals between 
records on this date ranged from 1–10 minutes during commissioning bursts (e.g., 13:32→
13:33→13:34→13:35, then 13:49→13:50→13:53…) and later ~8–15 minutes during 
steadier operation blocks. Photographic documentation of the gear teeth was also initiated 
on this date using a high-magnification digital microscope camera for surface tracking. 
In Time Domain Analysis, the RMS vibration levels at 45 RPS (and in later same-day checks 
at 15 RPS) were consistently low and steady, exhibiting the hallmark of a healthy drivetrain: 
no bursts, no intermittent spikes, and no slow drift. This low-variance RMS trace indicates: 
1. Stable shaft alignment and no assembly errors. 
2. No abnormal gear contact, or unbalance speed (speed fluctuations). 
In Spectral Domain Analysis, the companion spectrograms and FFT snapshots captured 
during operation showed a narrow-band signature dominated by the gear transmission and 
shafts. Peaks were sharp and of low amplitude, with minimal broadband energy and no 
sidebands around the Gear Mesh Frequencies (and their harmonics) — patterns that would 
normally indicate early abnormal anomalies associated with unstable meshing. High-
frequency content (above the mesh and its first few harmonics) was quiescent, consistent 
with an undamaged surface topology. 
The combination of low, stable RMS and a clean, narrow-band spectrum establishes a robust 
reference for the campaign that follows. With the new data-acquisition now calibrated and 
in service, any subsequent departures from this February 13 signature — be they gradual 
RMS lift, incipient sidebands, or broadband rise — are attributable to evolving contact 
conditions rather than instrumentation artifacts. This baseline therefore ensures later 
interpretation of fault progression observed across the dated sequences in the DATABASE. 
There were approximately 500 records for the baseline, evenly split between the two 
speeds. 
Mild Wear 
The earliest sign that the system had departed from the baseline came from the microscope 
tooth photographs taken on April 9. When compared directly with the healthy reference
