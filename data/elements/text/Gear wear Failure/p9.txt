Implement Alarm Escalation and Response Drills 
1. Define clear escalation rules when RMS or sideband thresholds are exceeded, 
ensuring rapid decision-making. 
2. Conduct operator training to interpret early-warning signs in both images and 
signals, enabling timely shutdown or controlled load reduction. 
Improve Data Acquisition and Analysis Tools 
1. Automate the synchronization of image data and vibration signals into a single 
diagnostic report. 
2. Incorporate AI-driven feature extraction from images (surface crack detection, 
pitting quantification) to support objective, repeatable assessments. 
3. Store all monitoring data in a central database to enable trend analysis and long-
term system health assessment. 
Schedule Post-Failure Review Protocols 
1. After any future gear replacement or failure, conduct structured reviews that 
combine metallurgical inspection, vibration records, and photographic analysis. 
2. Lessons learned should feed back into threshold calibration and preventive 
strategies. 
Overall Recommendation: 
A dual-path monitoring framework should be adopted, where visual inspection detects the 
earliest onset of wear, while vibration analysis tracks its progression and severity. Proactive 
thresholds and predictive modeling must guide intervention well before the transition into 
severe wear, thereby avoiding unexpected catastrophic failures such as the one observed on 
June 15. 
Conclusion 
The investigation into the progressive wear of the driven gear tooth, supported by both 
visual inspections and vibration analysis, leads to several clear conclusions regarding the 
evolution of the fault and its ultimate failure. 
At the outset, under baseline conditions, the system operated normally. The newly installed 
data acquisition system allowed simultaneous analysis in both the time and spectral 
domains, providing a reliable foundation for monitoring. No anomalies were detected, and 
the RMS levels, frequency signatures, and waveform patterns all reflected a healthy gear 
profile. 
The first signs of abnormality emerged during the mild wear stage, beginning on April 9. 
Visual inspection of the gear tooth photographs revealed subtle deviations from the healthy 
profile well before the signals reflected any variation. Between April 9 and April 23, the 
wear gradually became more evident in the images, while the vibration signals remained 
stable at lower wear cases. Onward did the time-domain signals begin showing slight
