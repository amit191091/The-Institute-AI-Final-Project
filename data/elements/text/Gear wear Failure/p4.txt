broadband noise floor above the mesh harmonics also rose noticeably compared to the 
baseline, confirming a spread of high-frequency energy consistent with contact roughening. 
At 15 RPS, a late-afternoon recording (15:32–15:58) showed even clearer differences: RMS 
was consistently above the earlier baseline, and spectral smearing broadened into a 
persistent high-frequency haze, indicative of mixed lubrication and developing asperity 
interaction. This dual evidence — photographic flattening of the flank region and repeatable 
vibro-acoustic departures — remained consistent through the following days. 
The April 27–29 campaigns documented progressive expansion of the worn zone in the 
microscope images, while vibration records at both 45 and 15 RPS sustained the elevated 
RMS and strengthened sideband structures. By May 3, photographs showed contact scars 
encroaching across multiple teeth, with clear edges rather than the diffuse polishing seen 
earlier, and vibration spectra exhibited broader and more numerous sidebands, alongside a 
further rise in the high-frequency floor. The RMS growth remained gradual, avoiding 
impulsive spikes, which aligned with a wear mechanism dominated by abrasive smoothing 
rather than fracture or chipping. 
Taken together, the evidence from April 23 through May 7 defines the Moderate Wear stage, 
characterized by: 
1. Photographs revealing enlarging contact scars and measurable loss of original flank 
curvature. 
2. RMS values at both operating speeds trending consistently upward by 10–20% 
relative to April 9. 
3. Spectral content displaying organized sideband families and a rising broadband floor 
across successive days. 
This stage thus marks the progression from micro-texture alteration into geometrically 
significant wear, recognizable in both visual and vibro-acoustic domains, but still without 
catastrophic features such as broken teeth or impulsive shock signatures.  
Severe Wear 
The transition into severe wear was first documented on May 14, when microscope 
photographs revealed sharp-edged scars and material loss extending across large sections of 
the tooth flank. Unlike the smoother polishing or gradual flattening seen during the 
moderate stage, the worn regions now displayed darker, roughened textures intermixed 
with bright reflective zones, characteristic of scuffing and surface tearing. Contact scars 
widened significantly, consuming much of the original flank geometry, with visible depth 
variations along the wear path. These changes were not confined to isolated teeth: by mid-
May, photographs confirmed that multiple consecutive teeth exhibited similar damage, 
establishing that the wear mechanism had advanced to a system-wide condition.
