stable and low, representing a healthy reference level. Corresponding gear images showed 
intact teeth profiles without visible irregularities. This baseline was later used as the 
benchmark for all subsequent comparisons. 
Mild Wear Progression 
The first signs of wear appeared on April 9, initially detected through tooth profile images. A 
small deviation from the healthy baseline was visible on the flanks of several teeth, although 
the signals remained largely unchanged at this early stage. Between April 9 and April 23, 
progressive visual changes were observed: tooth wear was visible in the photographs but 
did not yet manifest in the vibration data. From April 16 onward, subtle variations emerged 
in both time domain and spectral domain signals, with small irregularities beginning to 
disrupt the smooth baseline pattern. These deviations, while still minor, marked the 
transition toward measurable wear. By April 23, RMS values rose above the baseline, 
confirming the onset of detectable wear in both the visual and signal-based assessments. 
Moderate Wear Progression 
From the afternoon of April 23 until May 7, the system entered a phase characterized as 
moderate wear. During this period, both time domain and spectral indicators showed clear 
divergence from the healthy reference. RMS values exhibited a sustained upward trend, and 
the time domain signals developed pronounced irregularities, including asymmetry in the 
oscillatory waveforms. Spectral analysis confirmed the presence of secondary peaks not 
observed in the baseline, suggesting energy redistribution across higher harmonics. Images 
of the gear teeth revealed progressively deeper wear scars, with surface material visibly 
removed and sharpness lost at the edges. The alignment between visual degradation and 
signal variation validated the progression of wear beyond the mild stage. 
Severe Wear Progression 
From May 14 to June 11, the wear advanced into the severe stage. Signal data during this 
phase showed significant energy concentration shifts in the spectral domain, with 
broadening peaks and elevated noise levels. The time domain traces became increasingly 
erratic, reflecting unstable operation of the gear system. RMS values climbed markedly, far 
exceeding both the baseline and moderate wear levels. Corresponding tooth images 
depicted extensive surface damage, including deep pits and irregular wear patches. The 
severity of the damage made it clear that the component was approaching its functional 
limits, with reduced load-carrying capability and high risk of imminent failure. 
Failure Stage 
On June 15, the system experienced a critical failure directly attributed to the severe 
progression of wear. The failure manifested as a sudden reduction in energy observed 
across both time and spectral analyses, consistent with a loss of mechanical engagement 
within the gear set. The RMS levels, which had peaked during severe wear, showed an 
abrupt decline, reflecting the collapse of normal vibration transmission. Post-event 
inspection of the gear teeth confirmed the failure mechanism: extensive surface removal had
