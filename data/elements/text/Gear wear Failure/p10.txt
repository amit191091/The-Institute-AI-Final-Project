deviations in their patterns. A more distinct change appeared by W13, when the RMS values 
rose above the baseline. This established that the earliest effective indicator of wear was 
visual, while the dynamic response lagged behind. 
From April 23 to May 7, the gear entered the moderate wear stage. Here, both time-domain 
and frequency-domain analyses showed consistent deviations. The RMS values rose further, 
the waveform displayed irregularity, and the spectral data revealed emerging sidebands 
around the meshing frequency, pointing to the onset of mechanical instability. These 
findings matched the photographic evidence, where tooth surface deterioration became 
increasingly visible. The progression demonstrated that once wear passes a certain 
threshold, signal analysis becomes a reliable diagnostic tool, complementing the images. 
The severe wear stage was observed between May 14 and June 11. During this period, the 
mechanical degradation accelerated. The RMS levels escalated significantly, waveform 
distortion became pronounced, and spectral content showed clear harmonics and sideband 
growth. The photographic record confirmed substantial material loss and deformation of the 
tooth surface. At this point, the wear process transitioned from a detectable but controlled 
fault to one posing imminent risk of failure. 
On June 15, the progression culminated in a complete failure. The worn gear tooth fractured 
under load, resulting in a critical mechanical malfunction. The energy transmitted through 
the system dropped sharply, consistent with the interruption of load transfer due to the 
tooth breakage. This failure was the direct outcome of prolonged severe wear, highlighting 
the importance of early detection and timely intervention. 
In summary, the conclusions are as follows: 
1. The newly installed data acquisition system successfully enabled dual-domain 
analysis, confirming the value of combining time- and frequency-based monitoring. 
2. Photographic inspections provided the earliest indicators of wear, visible from April 
9, well before measurable vibration deviations. 
3. Mild wear persisted until April 23, during which signals remained largely unaffected, 
underscoring the importance of visual monitoring at early stages. 
4. Moderate wear from April 23 to May 7 was marked by consistent RMS increases, 
signal irregularities, and spectral sidebands, validating the progression of the fault. 
5. Severe wear between May 14 and June 11 showed rapid escalation, clear in both 
signals and photographs, demonstrating the systemâ€™s deteriorating condition. 
6. Final failure on June 15 occurred due to gear tooth fracture, directly caused by 
unchecked severe wear, explaining the observed reduction in system energy. 
These findings confirm the complementary role of image-based inspection and vibration 
analysis, and they establish a clear timeline of the wear process leading to failure.
