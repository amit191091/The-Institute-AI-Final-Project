images from February 13, subtle modifications of the tooth profile were visible: part of the 
contact area had been removed, showing the first physical evidence of surface alteration. 
This visual cue prompted a closer inspection of the contemporaneous vibration data. 
On April 9, sequences were collected at 45 RPS (12:22–13:09 and 17:47–18:20) and at 15 
RPS (13:45–14:16 and 18:51–19:15), while high-magnification images continued to 
document the tooth condition. In comparison to the baseline, the time-domain waveforms 
showed no gross abnormalities, and the RMS trend initially appeared steady. Yet in the 
spectra, small but systematic departures emerged. At 45 RPS, faint sidebands began to 
feather the principal mesh lines, and the broadband floor above the first few mesh 
harmonics lifted slightly relative to the exceptionally quiet baseline. Evening runs confirmed 
the persistence of these effects. At 15 RPS, spectra carried the same tendencies with more 
high-frequency smearing, reflecting lubrication sensitivity rather than discrete failure. 
There were no wide sideband families or discrete fault lines; rather, the vibration patterns 
suggested incipient modulation consistent with early flank wear. Across subsequent 
inspections, the photographs continued to reveal progressive changes, notably in the sets 
from April 16 and April 23, while vibration signals began to register measurable deviations 
only by the latter date. By April 23, RMS levels were consistently above the baseline, 
especially at 45 RPS, and the spectral lift was no longer ambiguous. 
Crucially, the timeline of evidence shows that the photographs provided the first definitive 
indications of wear, while the vibration data only followed with measurable confirmation by 
April 23. This ordering is important diagnostically: it rules out spurious instrument effects 
and highlights that the onset of Mild Wear spans those days, characterized by: 
1. First visible tooth profile deviations. 
2. Small but persistent RMS elevation. 
3. Nascent sideband activity with a slight broadband rise, well short of severe damage.  
Moderate Wear 
The transition from mild to moderate wear became evident on April 23 afternoon, when 
successive microscope photographs showed the first clearly measurable changes in the 
tooth contact geometry. Compared directly with the April 9 images, the worn area had 
grown beyond subtle polishing: a more distinct flattening of the flank region was visible, 
with contact extending deeper into the profile and localized material loss forming a brighter 
reflective patch. This physical evidence, captured under consistent magnification, signaled 
that wear had advanced into a stage where surface integrity was being materially altered. 
Contemporaneous vibration records reinforced this interpretation. At 45 RPS, an afternoon 
sequence from 14:12 to 14:54 and a subsequent evening set at 17:58–18:36 exhibited RMS 
levels elevated by roughly 10–15% above the April 9 reference, with the increases stable 
across consecutive runs. Spectrally, the shaft and gear-mesh lines remained dominant, but 
sideband families around the mesh frequencies, which had been faint feathering in early 
April, now emerged as systematic low-amplitude bands separated by shaft frequency. The
