teeth displayed clear spalling and breakaway of previously worn regions, indicating that the 
accumulated damage had exceeded the load-bearing capacity of the contact surfaces. 
The vibration evidence captured during this run reflects this breakdown. At both 15 and 45 
RPS, RMS levels showed unstable reductions compared to the peak values observed earlier 
in June. This apparent drop in energy does not signify recovery but rather a loss of dynamic 
stiffness and engagement efficiency due to surface collapse. Once significant material is 
removed, the gear pair no longer transmits load in a uniform manner. Instead, contact is 
intermittent and incomplete, producing lower average vibration energy despite the 
destructive nature of the event. 
Spectra from June 15 confirm this interpretation: while broadband noise and irregular 
sidebands remain, their energy distribution is fragmented, with missing components that 
were previously stable indicators of mesh dynamics. This reduction in measured energy is 
therefore a diagnostic marker of failure, not of improvement. It reflects the fact that the gear 
system has lost its ability to sustain consistent mesh forces — much of the excitation 
previously producing vibration has been dissipated by material loss, plastic deformation, 
and partial disengagement. Microscope evidence of fractured surfaces and spalled zones 
fully corroborates this interpretation. 
Accordingly, June 15 marks the transition from Severe Wear to Failure: 
1. Photographic evidence: complete breakdown of flank geometry, spalling, deep 
gouging, fractured material. 
2. Vibration evidence: unstable RMS values and reduced spectral energy due to loss of 
engagement. 
3. Physical meaning: the gear pair can no longer transfer energy effectively; the system 
has entered a failed state. 
Investigation Findings 
The investigation was based on continuous monitoring of the gear system using the newly 
installed data acquisition unit. The unit enabled parallel analysis of both the time and 
spectral domains, combined with systematic inspection of gear teeth profiles through high-
resolution images. This dual approach—signal monitoring and visual assessment—allowed 
for a comprehensive understanding of the wear progression. The findings are described 
chronologically, starting with the healthy baseline and continuing through mild, moderate, 
severe wear, and finally the failure stage. 
Baseline Condition 
From February 13 to April 8, the system was operating under normal conditions, and the 
initial dataset established the baseline profile for both vibration signals and spectral 
distribution. In the time domain, the signal presented a uniform oscillatory pattern without 
irregular fluctuations. Spectral analysis confirmed the absence of abnormal peaks, with 
energy concentrated at the expected harmonic frequencies. The calculated RMS values were
