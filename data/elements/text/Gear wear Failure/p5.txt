The vibration evidence during this stage paralleled the pronounced visual damage. At 45 
RPS, records from May 14 onward showed RMS values elevated by 25–40% above the April 
9 baseline, with fluctuations indicating unstable running conditions. Spectral content was 
markedly altered: sidebands around the mesh frequency became dominant features rather 
than faint modulations, appearing as dense families with higher amplitudes. The broadband 
noise floor above 5 kHz rose sharply, pointing to asperity impacts and increased surface 
roughness. 
At 15 RPS, the contrast was even more striking. RMS values spiked relative to moderate 
wear levels, and spectra showed both smearing and intermittent high-frequency bursts — 
signatures of unstable contact. As May progressed into June, the microscope evidence grew 
increasingly severe. By May 28, images showed deep scarring with localized pitting and 
possible micro-fractures at the tooth edges. The worn areas were no longer limited to profile 
flattening; instead, they exhibited irregular depth and texture, consistent with material 
removal rather than gradual smoothing. 
Parallel vibration data confirmed this escalation: at both speeds, RMS levels remained 
elevated, but more importantly, transient impulsive peaks appeared intermittently in the 
time traces. These impulses coincided with sudden rises in the high-frequency spectral 
band, suggesting localized crack initiation or debris entrainment within the mesh. By June 
11, the gear teeth displayed widespread, advanced surface failure. Contact regions had lost 
most of their original geometry, and scarring extended across the majority of the flank 
surface. 
Vibration measurements reinforced this terminal state: spectra were dominated by 
broadband noise and strong, irregular sidebands, with RMS values far above the initial 
baseline and unstable from run to run. This combined photographic and vibro-acoustic 
evidence defines the Severe Wear stage, characterized by: 
1. Extensive and system-wide loss of tooth surface geometry. 
2. Vibration signatures characterized by large RMS growth, dense sidebands, and 
impulsive transients. 
3. Evidence of local pitting and fracture precursors visible in the microscope images. 
Taken together, the period from May 14 to June 11 marks the culmination of the wear 
process. What began in early April as mild polishing and progressed through measurable 
geometric flattening by late April had, by mid-May, developed into advanced scarring, 
unstable dynamics, and precursors of catastrophic gear failure. 
Failure 
On June 15, the wear process reached its terminal stage and culminated in a failure event 
directly attributable to the progression of severe wear. Microscope inspection on this date 
revealed catastrophic surface damage: large sections of the tooth flanks were no longer 
intact, with deep gouges, fragmented edges, and visible fracture of material layers. Several
